/* Computer architecture: bit-level operations) A short value 
    is stored in 16 bits. Write a program that prompts the 
    user to enter a short integer and displays the 16 bits for
    the integer. Here are sample runs:

    Enter an integer: 5
    The bits are 0000000000000101
    Enter an integer: -5
    The bits are 1111111111111011

    (Hint: You need to use the bitwise right shift operator
    ( >> ) and the bitwise AND operator ( & ), which are 
    covered in Appendix G, Bitwise Operations.)
