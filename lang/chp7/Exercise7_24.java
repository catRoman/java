/** 
    (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
    problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from
    a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
    objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
    a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
    before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
    before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
    to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
    card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:

    Queen of Spades
    5 of Clubs
    Queen of Hearts
    4 of Diamonds
    Number of picks: 12
